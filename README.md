## Refed

**Refed (Rib Extaction and Fracture Detection Model) has a great performance on **extracting ribs** and **detecting fracture** from CT images.
In Rib extraction, we can get 23.2 ribs (96.7%) in average for every patients; In Fraction Detection,recall: 71%, precision: 100%.

Refed is consist by two modules: **rib extraction module** and **fracture detection module**.

### Workflow

![workflow](.github/tech_route.jpeg)

+ read slices of CT data and reconstruct, see [dcm read](preprocessing/separated)
+ separate bones using morphology and recognize all ribs, see [separated](preprocessing/separated), code see [ribs_obtain](preprocessing/separated/ribs_obtain)
+ match labels to the ribs, see [prepare_data](preprocessing/prepare_data), code see [join](preprocessing/prepare_data/join_xls_nii_rib.py)
+ (Optional,only for train) data preparation for train data, voc2007, see [prepare_data](preprocessing/prepare_data), code see[voc2007](preprocessing/prepare_data/voc2007/write_xml_and_pic_voc2007.py)
+ yolo-v3 predict for demo/test or train for train data, see [darknet/yolo-v3](models/README.md)
+ (Optional,only for test)predict scores.

## Installation and Dependencies

+ Install tensorflow. It is required that you have access to GPUs, The code is tested with Ubuntu 16.04
Python 3.6+, CUDA 9.0.176 and cudnn 7.4.2.
+ Python dependencies (with `pip3 install`) or  `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`:

+ Config darknet models

```shell
    cd ${Projects}/models
    git clone https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet
    cp models/darknet_cfg/yolov3-voc.cfg models/darknet/cfg/
    cp models/darknet_cfg/hurt_voc.data models/darknet/cfg/
    cp models/darknet_cfg/hurt_voc.names models/darknet/data/
```

## Demo and Test with pre-trained models

You can download pre-trained models, including GBDT model [HERE](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1_-dP4Y6wYDC5lqQ4uaIcXrAM-AHT_xd7), 
GBDT features [HERE](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1R8OkfLWniBhjFkAAYDlTWYwavt4dYaiB) and yolo-v3 models [HERE](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1E6OMPPBoIje3YZszMEypKb2v6APsqaF8). Put `feature.pkl`, `gbdt.pkl` under the project root path (`${project}/experiments/cfgs`) and 
Put `yolov3-voc_last.weights` under the project root path (`${projects}/experiments/cfgs`) 

```shell
    ./experiments/scripts/demo.sh [DCM_PATH]
    # DCM_PATH is folder path where CT slices existed.
```

## Train your own model

### Data Preparation

For dataSet structure and more information, follow the [README](preprocessing/README.md) under the `preprocessing` folder.

```shell
    ./experiments/scripts/nii_read.sh [DATA] [SLICING]
    ./experiments/scripts/dcm_read.sh [DATA]
    ./experiments/scripts/ribs_obtain.sh [LOGS_DIR] [FORMAT] [SLICING]
    ./experiments/scripts/prepare_data.sh
    # [DATA] in {updated48labeled_1.31, all_labeled} originated from different batches of data, has been defined in dcm_read.sh and nii_read.sh
    # [SLICING] in {0,1} is defined for interpolation interval, if 0, interval=1mm, else interval=slicing thickness 
    # [LOGS_DIR] used for debug
    # [FORMAT] '.dcm'
```

### train gbdt model (generated `feature.pkl` and `gbdt.pkl`)

step `./experiments/scripts/ribs_obtain.sh` will generate many separated bones and GBDT model will recognize all the ribs,
all the features for every bone will be saved in the path `./data/bone_info_merges`, you can added the misclassified bone in the
path `./data/csv_files/update_err_bone_info.csv` and run the below script, details see [gbdt model](preprocessing/rib_recognition)

```shell
    ./experiments/scripts/generate_gbdt.sh
```

### train your own yolo-v3 models

```shell
    cd ${projects}/models/darknet
    # only download once
    wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/darknet53.conv.74
    ./darknet detector train ./cfg/hurt_voc.data ./cfg/yolov3-voc.cfg ./darknet53.conv.74 -gpus 0,1,2,3
```
